cockpit-xnas v0.8.2

cockpit-xnas -- cockpit UI for XNAS
============ == ======= == === ====

This plugin not heavily documented yet, but that is probably not necessary. It's a cockpit UI to use and
configure XNAS from a web UI.

It uses cockpit-stdplgin as standard look and feel for this UI.

The following XNAS modules can be configured and used:
- xmount
- xremotemount
- xshare
- xnetshare
- logging
- dynmount
- settings (with check and fix functionality)

That's all for now ...
